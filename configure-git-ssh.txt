# Step1: Configure github repo for ssh connection

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "github-chefgs" -f "github-chefgs"

# Step 2: Configure SSH
# In ~/.ssh/ create a file called config with contents based on this:

#chefgs account
Host github.com-chefgs
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-chefgs

# Step 3A: Add the public key sign into github repo
# Step 3B: Add the public key sign of ur computer in which the clone occurs
	
# Step 4A: When cloning for the first time
# You can clone an existing GitHub repo if you don’t already have a local copy. The following syntax will ensure the remote is configured correctly to work with our setup:

git clone git@github.com-chefgs:chefgs/your-repo-name.git your-repo-name_user1
git clone git@github.com-chefgs:chefgs/playbook_repo.git playbook_repo_chefgs

#Step 4B: IF the repo already cloned - use below command
# Assuming you want to update origin you’ll need to do:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com-user1:user1/your-repo-name.git
